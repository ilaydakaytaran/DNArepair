# MAF_ANALYSIS_NER_PHASE2
The scripts under this folder are used for 
- checking the mutation count distributions of 33 TCGA studies
- creating a list of all background genes for each gene in of interest
- creating pseudo-NER gene lists with found background genes
- calculating the mutation percentage of the random lists and the genes of interest from mutation data of MC3 MAF file with all mutations (indicated with the word "background")
- calculating the mutation percentage of the random lists and the genes of interest from mutation data of MC3 MAF file with pathogenic mutations (indicated with the word "pathogenic")
- comparing the null case (random lists) with observed value (genes of interest) using right-tailed z-score test for significance
- visualising the findings

These analyses on MC3 MAF file is run for 4 gene lists related to Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER): All NER genes, Global Genome NER genes (NER-GG), Transciption-Coupled NER (NER-TCR) and NER genes common for NER-GG and NER-TCR processes (NER-Common).

The gene list used for preparing all background genes consists of other DNA damage repair genes, specifically Base Excision Repair (BER), Crosslink Repair (CLR), Double Strand Break Repair (DSB) and Mismatch Repair (MMR). Additional genes are selected from Gene Ontology term “positive regulation of multicellular organismal process” genes in the cases that no suitable genes were found from non-NER genes.

The analysis results of significantly mutated studies are found in [significants](https://github.com/ilaydakaytaran/DNArepair/tree/main/maf_analysis_ner_phase2/significants) directory.

# FILE CONTENTS

## input_files
- [mc3_manifest.txt](https://github.com/ilaydakaytaran/DNArepair/blob/main/maf_analysis_ner_phase2/input_files/mc3_manifest.txt): Manifest file to get the MC3 MAF file with GDC client. Using this file with GDC Client, the public MC3 MAF file was downloaded, containing mutation data for the samples of 33 TCGA studies. Three new columns were created to store Patient IDs, Sample IDs and Study IDs. Additionally, this public data has Entrez Gene ID column empty for all lines which is the main information we are using to identify genes. This column was filled by combining with Gene Symbol – Entrez ID pairs taken from NCBI.
- [genes_without_id.txt](https://github.com/ilaydakaytaran/DNArepair/blob/main/maf_analysis_ner_phase2/input_files/genes_without_id.txt): During the process of filling up the Entrez Gene ID column, 2633 symbols from the MC3 MAF file were unable to be matched to any ID. This file contains those genes with no corresponding gene ID which were eliminated from the analyses.
